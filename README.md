# Chroma-NumPadCalculator
A Razer Chroma NumPad calculator. Inputs are taken in on the number pad of the keyboard and spit back out using Chroma lighting.

###Usage  
This Chroma Application uses the num pad on a keyboard. Without one this application will not do much (yet...).  
Simply type in a number on the number pad, hit one of the four main mathematical operators (+,-,*,/) and type a second nummber. From 
here clicking the ENTER key will cause the program to reset its numbers to 0 and spit out the result in Chroma. OR you can select another
operator and continue on with the calculations.  
  
_So far only Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide, are supported by this application._
