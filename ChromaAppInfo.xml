    <title>Chrome NumPad Calculator</title> <!-- Title of your application -->
    <description>A calculator that works through the number pad on Razer chroma keyboards. 
    This application works by registering the keys as hotkeys in windows to pull in the numbers. 
    The program will continually calculate more until the Enter key is pressed. 
    At that point the final answer will be spit back out digit by digit for the final answer. 
    The command window also prints out everything input and outputted as needed.
